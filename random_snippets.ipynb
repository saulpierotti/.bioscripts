    "## Parsing the output summary of a PDBeFold search\n",
    "The sample file for this snippet is in `./sample_files/pdbfold_output.dat`.\n",
    "The output of PDBeFold is somewhat difficult to parse and very information rich, so I convert it to a pandas dataframe. The default separator is space `\\s+`.\n",
    "In front of the PDB ID of the query and of the target it is present the string 'PDB' separated from the actual ID by a single space. When parsing with the normal pandas.read_csv() this cause 'PDB' and the actual ID to go into different columns of the dataframe and not match with the column headers. If I skip a single space as separator I cannot parse correctly the column headers since some of them are separated by a single space. The easiest solution that I found is to just remove the 'PDB' string with sed before reading the file."
